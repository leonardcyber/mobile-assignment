# Mobile take home assessment

## Description

A fictional company is building a navigation app called Breeze. They want to be able to provide faster routes to their customers by collecting in trip data from other customers on traffic conditions and more.

You've been hired to build their mobile-app proof-of-concept with the following requirements: 

- Live location collection from each user when driving to be used in creating routes 
- A local sqlite database for storing those data points 

Each location point should have a timestamp and all other location related attributes that can be collected from the mobile client.

## UI 

Make the UI as functional and as easy to use as possible. We care more about your ability to create functional interfaces than beautiful ones at this stage. The UI should have the following: 

- A way to start / stop the collection of data points 
- A place to see how many data points have been stored in the sqlite instance 

No other UI elements / flows are required. 

## Technologies 

We would like you to complete the work sample in React Native. Feel free to reach out with any questions.
